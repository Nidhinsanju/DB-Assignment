1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
   -From the above given diagram we can understand that there are many products ,each product has unique ID,category_id,inventory_id,discount_id.These unique ID helps us to understand and find the specify product using the Product ID.Simalilary from the diagram we can also understand that the products are of different cateoriges.The Category_id helps us find the category to which the product belongs and it also gives us data about the category with its name,descprition created at,modified at,deleted at.or when the Product was added to this Category if it was a existing category.
2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
   -This means that the category_ID in the Product should reference the id column in the product_category. This ensures that each product's category must exist in the Category table.If the catrgory_ID does not refer to any id or is not found in the product_category in the database.then error will be thrown.
