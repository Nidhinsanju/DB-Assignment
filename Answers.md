1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
   -From the above diagram we can understand that there are many products, each product has a unique ID,category_id,inventory_id, and discount_id. This unique ID helps us to understand and find the specific product using the Product ID. Similarly from the diagram, we can also understand that the products are of different categories. The Category_id helps us find the category to which the product belongs and it also gives us data about the category with its name, description created at, modified at, and deleted at. or when the Product was added to this Category if it was an existing category.
2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
   -This means that the category_ID in the Product should reference the id column in the product_category. This ensures that each product's category must exist in the Category table.If the category_id does not refer to any id or is not found in the product_category in the database. then an error will be thrown.
